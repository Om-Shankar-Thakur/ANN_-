# Crop Yield Prediction

## Overview
Crop Yield Prediction is a project aimed at forecasting the yield of crops based on various factors such as weather conditions, soil quality, and agricultural practices. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this system helps farmers make informed decisions regarding crop planning, resource allocation, and risk management.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Om-Shankar-Thakur/crop-yield-prediction.git
