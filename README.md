# AI for Sustainable Agriculture

## Overview
Welcome to the AI for Sustainable Agriculture project! This repository hosts a comprehensive AI solution aimed at revolutionizing farming practices to promote sustainability, optimize resource management, and improve productivity. By integrating various AI-powered modules, we offer a holistic approach to address key challenges in agriculture.

## Project Details
Our project focuses on five main components:

1. **Crop Monitoring and Management:** We have implemented Plant Disease Detection which is focused on automating the identification of diseases in plants using machine learning techniques. By analyzing images of diseased plants, the system can classify and diagnose the type of disease present, enabling early detection and intervention to prevent crop losses.

2. **Precision Agriculture:** Precision is analyzed via crop yield prediction is a project aimed at forecasting the yield of crops based on various factors such as weather conditions, soil quality, and agricultural practices. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this system helps farmers make informed decisions regarding crop planning, resource allocation, and risk management.

3. **Crop Yield Prediction:** Built predictive models that forecast crop yields based on historical data, environmental factors, and agronomic parameters ( weather conditions, soil quality, and crop type). This empowers farmers to make informed decisions regarding crop planning, harvesting schedules, and market forecasts. 

4. **Climate Resilience:** Developed AI solutions to assess climate risks and vulnerabilities in agriculture, addressing extreme weather events, droughts, and temperature fluctuations. We provide adaptive strategies and mitigation measures to enhance the resilience of farming systems to climate change impacts. This is a Python-based application that predicts the likelihood of floods, droughts, or normal rainfall conditions based on historical rainfall data. The model uses the ElasticNet regression algorithm from the scikit-learn library to make predictions.

5. **Market Intelligence:** Utilizing AI algorithms to analyze market trends, consumer preferences, and supply chain dynamics to assist farmers in making informed decisions about crop selection and marketing strategies. We integrate price forecasting and risk management tools to optimize profitability and reduce market volatility.
