# Plant Disease Detection

## Overview
Plant Disease Detection is a project focused on automating the identification of diseases in plants using machine learning techniques. By analyzing images of diseased plants, the system can classify and diagnose the type of disease present, enabling early detection and intervention to prevent crop losses.
